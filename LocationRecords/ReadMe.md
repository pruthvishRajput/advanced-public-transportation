The bus module android application is used for recording real-time location traces of buses. Three versions of bus module application were used for recording location traces with minor changes. In the first version `RawRecords`, the `time` was recorded in <tt>'dd Month YYYY hh mm ss'</tt>  string format (for eg: *8 Jan 2018 07:41:43*). Whereas in the second version `RawRecordEpoch`, the time was recorded in the epoch format. and in the third version `RawRecordEpochSpeed`, the additional parameter `GPS Speed` was recorded. The raw location records correspoding to each version are stored separately in the folder corresponding to version name.

The name of file follows the `RouteName+BusID?LastRecordUploadTimeStamp`. For instance, `ISCON_PDPU+1?08_01_2018_07_41_43` represents that the file consists of location records on *ISCON_PDPU* route updated from bus having ID *1* and the last record had the time stamp *08_01_2018_07_41_43*.
