The bus module android application is used for recording real-time location traces of buses. Three versions of bus module application were used for recording location traces with minor changes. In the first version `RawRecords`, the `time` was recorded in <tt>'dd Month YYYY hh mm ss'</tt>  string format (for eg: *8 Jan 2018 07:41:43*). Whereas in the second version `RawRecordEpoch`, the time was recorded in the epoch format. and in the third version `RawRecordEpochSpeed`, the additional parameter `GPS Speed` was recorded. The raw location records correspoding to each version are stored separately in the folder corresponding to version name.

The name of file follows the `RouteName+BusID?LastRecordUploadTimeStamp`. For instance, `ISCON_PDPU+1?08_01_2018_07_41_43` represents that the file consists of location records on *ISCON_PDPU* route updated from bus having ID *1* and the last record had the time stamp *08_01_2018_07_41_43*. Kindly note that one file can contain one or more trip(s). Thus, before working with the location record, one need to separate the records as per the trips. The logic that we used in our work is to check for the time difference of more than 30 min. between two consecutive records. If they have time difference of more than 30 min. they are considered as two different trips.
