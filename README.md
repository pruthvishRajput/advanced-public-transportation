# advanced-public-transportation
This is the demonstration of our work "Advanced Urban Public Transportation System for Indian Scenarios"[1]. It includes the location records of bus traces for different routes and the jupyter notebook helps the reader to develop the automatic bus-stop detector and arrival time predictor by their own.  

The development is based on open source softwares and libraries such as [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and it's python api [pymongo](https://api.mongodb.com/python/current/), [MQTT](mqtt.org) communication using [EMQ broker](http://emqtt.io/) and it's client side API ([eclipse's paho-mqtt](https://www.eclipse.org/paho/clients/dotnet/), [pypi's paho-mqtt](https://pypi.org/project/paho-mqtt/)), [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org), [scipy](https://scipy.org/), [jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/), and android based applications developed in [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).
